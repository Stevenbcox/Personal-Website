                <h2>Snowboarding</h2>
                <p>I have been snowbaording since 2016 and absolutly love it. I try to go at least 12 times a year.
                I was grateful enough to take a trip to stowe mountain in Vermont, and got to tour the burton snowboards facility.
                My regular spot to go to is pine knob, Its not the biggest hills but has a very great terrain park with big jumps, rails, and boxes.</p>

                <h2>Playing guitar</h2>
            <p>Playing guitar is something i recently picked up and havent stopped
                since its fun to play the same songs you hear when your in the car
                listening to the radio, or just your favorites.</p>
