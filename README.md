# Personal-Website

I made a website including image links, links to my other pages, and using 
css to make the style of my website look appealing to the eye. 

The website has three pages total including a home, about me, and a portfolio page.

On the portfolio page, I have included another folder introducing a typing game I have made using other outside resources.

I have used javascript to display the phrase "Hello world" in the console of the inspector

All files and folders for the images and the typing game are included in the repository in a neat and readable format.
